I'm currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science (MCS) at the University of California, Irvine. 
 
Before starting my MCS, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering at MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women in India.  During my undergraduate studies, I delved into a wide range of coursework, including <b>Database Management, Data Mining & Warehousing, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, Internet of Things, Java Full Stack Technologies, Networks & Information Security, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Statistics</b>. 

I have maintained a perfect <b></b>GPA of 4.0</b> in both my Masters and Bachelors.

##  **Work Experience:**
In terms of work experience, I had the opportunity to work as a <b>Technology Analyst at Citicorp Services India Limited India</b>.  I contributed to streamlining payment processes, reducing transaction time, and enhancing client satisfaction through the implementation of Junit tests. Moreover, I orchestrated the deployment of high-quality applications using Scrum, Agile Methodology, Java, and Maven.

I also worked as a Summer Analyst Intern at Citicorp Services India Limited, on software development and segregation of the Monolithic Codebase Migration in the TTS Unit. My efforts led to the optimization of Microservices deployment pipeline, resulting in faster release cycles and increased customer satisfaction. 

In addition to my experience at Citicorp, I served as a Data Science Intern at Cloud Counselage. During my internship, I developed a classifier to predict a student's eligibility for an internship program. I helped to create helpful visualizations and obtained an Accuracy of 95% and an AUC score of 92%.

##  **Projects:**
One project I'm proud of is <b>"Sequence Level Understanding of the 3D Organization of Genome</b>", where I used Markov Models and CNNs to distinguish between highly interacting and non-interacting genome regions. I achieved an accuracy of 99% and an AUC score of 80% using CNNs on real genomic data. I also applied the DeepShap algorithm to find traits that make certain regions more interactive. This interpretability aspect was crucial in gaining a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms driving genome organization and function. This work has expanded my understanding of many biological ideas and procedures. In addition, I discovered the applicability of deep learning and statistical methods in fields like precision medicine.

I was also one of 100 students chosen from my alma mater to receive the training of the CitiBridge Program. The first phase dealt with finance and banking, as well as hands-on
experience with technologies such as SpringBoot, Angular, Java, Software Design, and Micro-services. In the second half, I created a full-stack application in a team of 5. It was a sector-based trading suggestion app for India's Nifty 50 companies.

I worked on "Carify," a web app that predicts car maintenance prices using machine learning and provides a health and maintenance index for car parts based on various factors.  "Carify" was recognized as a "Certified Potential Real Venture" by the Wadhwani Foundation after global jury evaluation from 11 countries. The paper CARIFY ‚Äì
Predicting Car Maintenance Costs using Artificial Intelligence has been published in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology Volume 9, Issue 9, September 2022.

I also developed "MentorHub," an online web app that facilitates mentorship and guidance for juniors by matching them with seniors at a university.

## Technical Skills
Here's a glimpse of the skills I bring to the table:

- **Programming Languages & Databases**: C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R, SQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Colab, OpenShift, AWS, Maven, CI/CD, REST API, Jupyter
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, NLTK
- **Certifications**: GCP Essentials, Google Developer Essentials


##  **Hackathon Experience:**
- Participated in prestigious hackathons like the Smart India Hackathon 2020 and IBM Call for Code 2020.
- Won the Techgig Geek Goddess American Express AI ML Hackathon in 2021.
- First prize in the ‚ÄòSpotle AI-thon - AI for Good‚Äô Business Plan competition by Spotle in 2020, wherein my team developed a FairFood App that could help to prevent wastage of food and eradicate world hunger.

## **Volunteer Work:**
- Volunteered with Bhumi Paws Pune NGO, showcasing commitment to social causes.

##  **Extracurricular Activities:**
- Currently serving as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 90: Systems Engineering & Technical Communication at UCI, indicating expertise in technical communication and a passion for teaching.
- Held leadership position as the Head of Website at the Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision Society
- Student Representative at the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at Cummins College of Engineering for Women where I volunteered in the STEM outreach programs for underrepresented children in society.
- ET Campus Coding Star 2021 award and ET Campus Star 2022 award by Economic Times, India



Feel free to get in touch with me, and I'm excited to connect and collaborate in the world of technology, machine learning, and beyond.
