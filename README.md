<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Shreya Pawaskar. 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="left">
I'm currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science (MCS) at the University of California, Irvine. Before starting my MCS, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering at MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women in India.

In terms of work experience, I had the opportunity to work as a Technology Analyst at Citicorp Services India Limited India.
I also worked as a Summer Analyst Intern at Citicorp Services India Limited. In addition to my experience at Citicorp, I served as a Data Science Intern at Cloud Counselage. During my internship, I developed a classifier to predict a student's eligibility for an internship program.

One project I'm proud of is "Sequence Level Understanding of the 3D Organization of Genome," where I used Markov Models and CNNs to distinguish between highly interacting and non-interacting genome regions. I achieved an accuracy of 99% and an AUC score of 80% using CNNs on real genomic data. I also applied the DeepShap algorithm to find traits that make certain regions more interactive.

Another project I worked on is "Carify," a web app that predicts car maintenance prices using machine learning and provides a health and maintenance index for car parts based on various factors. I also developed "MentorHub," an online web app that facilitates mentorship and guidance for juniors by matching them with seniors at a university.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB. My interests primarily revolve around Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

I'm actively involved in hackathons, having participated in events such as the Smart India Hackathon 2020 and IBM Call for Code 2020. I also volunteered with the Bhumi Paws Pune NGO. In 2021, I achieved a significant milestone by winning the Techgig Geek Goddess American Express AI ML Hackathon.

Feel free to get in touch with me, and I'm excited to connect and collaborate in the world of technology, machine learning, and beyond.
